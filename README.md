# Taktile Frontend Challenge

## Logistics

* One week take home challenge
* Fork the repository and hand in your version the day before your interview
  (either a link to a public code base or tarball)
* We will review code and the interview will be about discussing your solution.
* Timebox the challenge to 4 hours

## Goals

* Write a SPA to the given backend. Goal is it to create a frontend for labeling
transaction data. Transactions can have from 0 to n labels. Create the frontend
in a way that allows rapid manual tagging of transactions with labels.

* If possible, use React with Typescript for the SPA.

* The website should be responsive, but don't worry about the aesthetics too much.

* Timebox the challenge to 4 hours, so don't worry about implementing CI/CD.
